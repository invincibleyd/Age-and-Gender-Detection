# Age-and-Gender-Detection
CodeClause Task 2

**Project Title: Age and Gender Detection with DeepFace**

### Description:
This project utilizes the powerful DeepFace library to implement accurate age and gender detection from facial images. DeepFace leverages deep learning models to analyze facial features, providing a robust solution for predicting both age and gender with high precision.

### Features:
1. **Age Detection:** The model predicts the age range of individuals in the given images, providing valuable insights for various applications, including targeted marketing and content recommendation.

2. **Gender Detection:** Accurately determines the gender of individuals, contributing to demographic analysis and personalized user experiences.

3. **DeepFace Library:** The project is built on the DeepFace library, simplifying the implementation of facial analysis tasks through pre-trained deep learning models. This enables users to seamlessly integrate age and gender detection into their applications.

### How to Use:
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Usage:**
   - Utilize the provided Jupyter Notebook or integrate the `deepface` library into your Python scripts.
   - Input facial images and receive predictions for age and gender.


### Acknowledgments:
This project is made possible by the DeepFace library. Special thanks to the contributors and the open-source community for their continuous support and advancements in the field of facial analysis.

### Future Improvements:
- Incorporate real-time processing for age and gender detection in video streams.
- Fine-tune the model for improved accuracy on specific age and gender demographics.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use this project for your applications. Happy coding!
